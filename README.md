## Navigating

Hydro Homie is a Compose app built with [Mavericks](https://airbnb.io/mavericks/#/)

In order to navigate the codebase, take a look at the directory structure:

Each screen is setup in it's own feature package, which is usually split up into the `domain` and the `surface`
- `domain` is usually any UI state classes needed to help render the screen
- `surface` containts the screen entrypoint, which will also hold a full preview of the screen as well as any specific components

Data dependencies are wrapped with a `Repository`, but it's really just an interface that sits on top.

The core entry point is in `MavericksApp` and feel free to disregard any `workflow` components as they are remnants of using [Workflow](https://square.github.io/workflow/). If you are curious, this repo was used to compare architecture libraries which I talked about at [DroidconSF 2022](https://www.droidcon.com/2022/06/28/state-machines-and-hopeful-dreams/)
